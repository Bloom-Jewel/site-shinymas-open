## Contribution Guide and Notes
- `card_transliterations.csv`
  - **Avoid translations** (Ironic? Read the filename first).
    - Exceptions are applicable for **katakanas**.
      
      It may have non-English term, so if possible try to find the closest meaning of it.
      
    - **Full Romanisation** for non-katakanas.
      
      This enforces standard roman characters (Natural 7-bit ASCII) instead Hepburn confusing cuts and such.
      
  - Replace symbols into spaces if possible.
    
    It does seems strange, this rule may be removed somewhere in future.
    (Not a must, but please for now)
  
  - Feel free to add new entry. However the actual data is sorted through internal ID.
    
    Sort hint: `Type` ASC, `Rarity` ASC, `Character` ASC, `Index` ASC.
  
  - **Please look carefully** when you are inputting either japanese or transliterated one.
    - This refer on how csv handled. Surround it by quotes if you are not sure.
    - **Make sure it's only two columns**
  
  - Typo and Spacing fixes are **OK**.
